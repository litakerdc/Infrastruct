#Infrastruct

* Our current running title is Infrastruct, however this is subject to change.
* Infrastruct is developed by: Alex Harttree and Dylan Litaker
* Infrastruct is an ioS application with the intended user device being an iPhone. Infrastruct may also become a standalone web application at a later date.
* Infrastruct is a Public Service / User Reporting application that allows users to report local Infrastructure problems and get those user reports to the people who have the capability to fix them.
* Summary: This app will be used to provide database updates real time to users of the app. Users can report local infrastructure problems on the app, and the report will be added to the database. The database can be used to calculate what issues need to be addressed and how they should be prioritized based on the frequency of user reports and the severity of the incident reported.
